# ManualML
A series of mini-projects realized for degree course consisting of manual implementations of the following:
- Non-recursive neural networks trained with gradient descent, momentum and RMSProp for regression and classification tasks
- Kohonen networks (self-organizing maps) for clustering
- Classical and neuroevolutionary genetic algorithms for cutting stock problem and neural networks optimization
